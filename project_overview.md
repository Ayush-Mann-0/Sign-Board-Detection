## Abstract

This project is an Android application for real-time road sign detection and recognition using machine learning. Here's what makes it special:

**Core Functionality:**

- Uses TensorFlow Lite for efficient on-device inference
- Processes live camera feed, images, and videos for sign detection
- Identifies and classifies various road signs in real-time

**Three Main Modes:**
• **Image Detection**: Analyze static images from gallery or camera
• **Video Detection**: Process pre-recorded videos for sign recognition
• **Live Detection**: Real-time sign detection through camera feed

**Key Features:**
• GPU acceleration for enhanced performance
• Configurable detection parameters (confidence, max detections)
• Object tracking for smooth visualization
• Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) to eliminate redundant detections
• Modular architecture for easy model updates

**User Experience:**

- Clean settings interface for customization
- Adjustable frame rate limits
- Real-time inference time display
- Intuitive UI with smooth animations

Perfect for driver assistance, traffic analysis, or educational purposes, this app demonstrates the power of mobile machine learning in real-world applications.
